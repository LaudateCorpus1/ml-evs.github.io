## Software

 Most of my software work can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ml-evs).

- [`matador`](http://matador.science) is a Python package for the aggregation, standardisation and analysis of the results of first-principles computations, with a focus on battery materials.
- [`ilustrado`](http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~me388/ilustrado) is a Python package that implements a highly-customisable, massively-parallel genetic algorithm for *ab initio* crystal structure prediction.
- [`optimade-python-tools`](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/optimade-python-tools) is a Python library of tools for implementing and consuming [OPTiMaDe](www.optimade.org) APIs, which I help to develop and maintain.
- [`odbx.science`](http://odbx.science) a public OPTiMaDe API that hosts the Morris group's crystal structures.
